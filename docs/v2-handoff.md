The 2026-04-27 plan is now the active long-running development control document. It records the default agent operating rule, mandatory start sequence, work package queue, validation matrix, and update rules for taking GPF toward the natural-language gray-box bug repair target without stopping after every small step.

## Current Repository Shape

`main` is now intentionally V2-only.

Current top-level tracked shape is:

- `.cursor`
- `.github`
- `docs`
- `scripts`
- `v2`
- root metadata files such as `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `LICENSE`

The old MCP system is no longer present on `main`.
Use `legacy/mcp` only when historical reference is required.

## Current State

V2 phase 1 minimal chain is already passing.

The server-split refactor is also no longer just planned.
The current `main` branch now has a materially split V2 core:

- `server.py` as the entry shell
- `tool_dispatch.py` as the top-level tool branch layer
- `request_layer.py` as the bounded user-request layer
- `runtime_orchestration.py` as the runtime execution coordinator
- `process_probe.py` as the Godot process / editor probe layer
- `teardown_verification.py` as the stop-verification and flow-lock layer

Verified:

- V2 preflight passes on `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`
- V2 minimal flow passes on `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`
- V2 interactive flow passes on `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`
- V2 `generate_basic_flow` writes `basicflow.json` + `basicflow.meta.json`
- V2 default `run_basic_flow` passes against project-local `basicflow.json` after plugin sync and clean restart
- V2 can run a stale project-local `basicflow` when `--allow-stale-basicflow` is explicitly provided
- V2 can analyze why the current project-local `basicflow` is stale through `analyze_basic_flow_staleness`
- V2 `generate_basic_flow` accepts either `--answers-file` or direct structured answers for the 3 generation questions
- V2 `get_basic_flow_generation_questions` returns the structured 3-question contract plus the current startup-scene hint
- V2 `get_basic_flow_user_intents` returns a small structured intent catalog plus `primary_recommendation` / `secondary_actions`, so the upper conversational layer can pick `run_basic_flow`, `generate_basic_flow`, or `analyze_basic_flow_staleness` based on project state
- V2 `resolve_basic_flow_user_request` is now a thin adapter that matches a small set of basicflow-related user phrases and returns the current project-aware recommended action
- V2 also supports a session form for the 3-question generation flow: start -> answer -> complete
- V2 generated `basicflow` can now conservatively switch to a project-specific path when obvious targets are detected
- V2 validated a real project-specific path on `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`: `StartButton -> GameLevel -> GamePointerHud -> closeProject`
- V2 project-specific target inference is no longer limited to that exact path; it can now conservatively infer:
  - `button_to_scene_with_runtime_anchor`
  - `button_to_scene_root`
  - fallback `generic_runtime_probe`
- `run_basic_flow` now syncs the repository plugin into the target project before preflight and launch
- V2 has an experimental Windows `isolated_runtime` mode for `run_basic_flow`
- `run_basic_flow` now returns an `isolation` object so callers can distinguish shared desktop vs isolated desktop execution
- isolated-runtime payloads now also include `host_desktop_name` and `separate_desktop`
- the latest repository-wide V2 unit-test run in this workspace passed with `Ran 199 tests`, `OK`
- the latest fixed regression bundle against `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame` reported `ok: true`; its internal `v2_unit_tests` reported `Ran 97 tests`, `OK`
- V2 now supports generic runtime evidence actions `sample` and `observe`
- V2 now supports evidence-backed `check` steps through `evidenceRef`
- V2 validated [runtime_evidence_sample_flow.json](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/flows/runtime_evidence_sample_flow.json) in real `play_mode`, with `runtime_evidence_summary.record_count: 1` and `project_close.status: verified`
- V2 validated [runtime_evidence_observe_flow.json](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/flows/runtime_evidence_observe_flow.json) in real `play_mode`, with `runtime_evidence_summary.record_count: 1`, evidence id `scene_change_window`, and event scene `res://scenes/game_level.tscn`
- V2 can now accept bounded model evidence plans through `--evidence-plan-json` and `--evidence-plan-file`
- `plan_bug_repro_flow` now inserts accepted model evidence `sample`, `observe`, and `check` steps into candidate flows
- `plan_bug_fix` now includes runtime evidence summaries, compact records, evidence refs, and evidence-backed acceptance checks
- V2 can accept bounded model fix proposals through `--fix-proposal-json` and `--fix-proposal-file`
- V2 exposes `repair_reported_bug` as a top-level tool for natural-language bug repair requests
- the current `repair_reported_bug` smoke with the enemy red-flash scenario returned `status: awaiting_model_evidence_plan`, `blocking_point: repair_reported_bug requires an accepted model evidence plan before running repro`, and `next_action: provide_evidence_plan_json_or_file`
- `repair_reported_bug` has also reached `status: fixed_and_verified` for the injected `hit_feedback_shader_not_updated` behavior bug when supplied with `v2/examples/hit_feedback_evidence_plan.json` and `v2/examples/hit_feedback_fix_proposal.json`
- `repair_reported_bug` waiting states now include model-facing instruction payloads: `model_evidence_plan_instruction` and `model_fix_proposal_instruction`
- `repair_reported_bug` result payloads now include `artifact_summary` and `repair_summary` after repro has run
- `repair_reported_bug` result payloads now include `user_report` after repro has run
- V2 rejects overlapping flow runs for one project with `FLOW_ALREADY_RUNNING`
- V2 rejects manual multi-editor runs for one project with `MULTIPLE_EDITOR_PROCESSES_DETECTED`
- user language like `跑基础测试流程` should be interpreted as `run_basic_flow`

Current product-priority judgment:

- `input isolation` should now be treated as later TODO work unless it directly blocks the next core bug loop
- further `basicflow` expansion should also be treated as later TODO work unless it directly blocks the next core bug loop
- regression-bundle final Godot cleanup should also be treated as later TODO work unless it directly blocks the next core bug loop
- the next mainline should return to the core GPF product loop described in [2026-04-14-gpf-core-direction.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-14-gpf-core-direction.md)

Current bug-focused implementation status:

- `collect_bug_report`, `analyze_bug_report`, `define_bug_assertions`, `plan_bug_repro_flow`, `run_bug_repro_flow`, `rerun_bug_repro_flow`, `plan_bug_fix`, `apply_bug_fix`, `run_bug_fix_regression`, `verify_bug_fix`, and `repair_reported_bug` now exist on the CLI/tool path
- `observe_bug_context`, `define_bug_checks`, and `plan_bug_investigation` now also exist on the CLI/tool path
- `start_test_project_bug_round`, `seed_test_project_bug`, and `restore_test_project_bug_round` now also exist on the CLI/tool path
- bug-focused repro no longer classifies by failed step guessing; it now classifies by execution phase
- bug-focused repro results are persisted under `pointer_gpf/tmp/last_bug_repro_result.json`
- rerun verification after a code change is persisted under `pointer_gpf/tmp/last_bug_fix_verification.json`
- regression results after a code change are persisted under `pointer_gpf/tmp/last_bug_fix_regression.json`
- the combined verification summary is persisted under `pointer_gpf/tmp/last_bug_fix_verification_summary.json`
- `plan_bug_fix` now reads persisted repro evidence instead of running a new repro internally
- planner logic has been reduced to base flow reuse, explicit trigger insertion, and explicit precondition/postcondition steps
- `observe_bug_context` now summarizes startup scene, current assertion set, project-local basicflow hints, runtime diagnostics, latest repro evidence, latest fix verification, and candidate file read order for model use
- `observe_bug_context` now also includes `project_static_observation` for behavior-bug work. The first implementation slice scans project scripts/scenes/resources for candidate files, behavior methods, scene nodes, signal connections, visual state surfaces, resource references, and runtime evidence target candidates. A real `observe_bug_context` run for "敌人受击后没有闪红" returned `res://scripts/enemies/test_enemy.gd`, `_apply_hit_effect`, `Sprite3D`, shader `hit_count`, and sample/observe target candidates.
- `define_bug_checks` now returns a bounded executable check set with assertion-linked check ids and mapped flow step ids where available
- `plan_bug_investigation` now turns that observation into grouped runtime actions, executable check candidates, a machine-readable executable check set, failure branches, and repair focus candidates
- bug-focused repro artifacts now also persist `executable_checks`, `check_results`, and `check_summary`
- `plan_bug_fix` now reads persisted repro check evidence and returns `evidence_summary` plus `acceptance_checks` for rerun
- runtime evidence records are now persisted when present in flow or repro results
- `observe_bug_context` now exposes runtime evidence capabilities and latest runtime evidence summaries for model use
- `runtime_bridge.gd` now supports evidence-backed sample value predicates: `value_seen`, `equals_at_least_once`, `sample_value_equals`, `first_value_equals`, and `last_value_equals`. The fixed regression bundle now includes `runtime_evidence_value_predicate_flow.json`, which samples `StartButton.visible=true` in real `play_mode` and verifies `value_seen` plus `last_value_equals`.
- `runtime_bridge.gd` now samples `shader_param` from `GeometryInstance3D.material_override` as well as `CanvasItem.material`. The fixed regression bundle includes `runtime_evidence_shader_param_flow.json`, which enters `GameLevel`, samples `/root/GameLevel/TestEnemy/Sprite3D` shader `hit_count=0`, and verifies the evidence with `value_seen`.
- `runtime_bridge.gd` now supports bounded `callMethod` steps for gray-box behavior triggers, and also supports `aimAt` plus `shoot` for player-input shooting checks. The fixed regression bundle includes `runtime_evidence_hit_feedback_flow.json`, which enters `GameLevel`, samples `TestEnemy/Sprite3D` shader `hit_count=0`, sends equivalent mouse motion to aim `FPSController` at `Sprite3D`, sends a left mouse button input event through the player controller, then samples shader `hit_count=1` in real `play_mode`.
- `runtime_bridge.gd` sample windows now wait through Godot timers instead of blocking the main thread, so `_process(delta)` can advance while evidence is being sampled. The fixed regression bundle now includes `runtime_evidence_enemy_movement_flow.json`, which verifies that the triangle `TestEnemy` changes `position` over time in real `play_mode`.
- the external test project now documents the triangle enemy's irregular player-orbit movement in `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame\pointer_gpf\project_context\07-game-design.md`, and `project_context\index.json` references that design note.
- model evidence plan support now lives in [bug_evidence_plan.py](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/mcp_core/bug_evidence_plan.py)
- model evidence plans now accept `callMethod`, `aimAt`, and `shoot` trigger steps. [hit_feedback_evidence_plan.json](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/examples/hit_feedback_evidence_plan.json) samples shader `hit_count`, aims the player at the enemy sprite, shoots through `FPSController`, then verifies the changed shader value.
- when `repair_reported_bug` is waiting for an evidence plan, it now returns `model_evidence_plan_instruction` with the expected schema, allowed actions, allowed phases, project fact hints, prior rejection reasons, and a compact example
- [v2-model-evidence-plan-contract.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/v2-model-evidence-plan-contract.md) documents the evidence plan schema and examples for scene transition, HUD spawn, animation feedback, shader feedback, and hit feedback
- bounded model fix proposal support now lives in [bug_fix_proposal.py](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/mcp_core/bug_fix_proposal.py)
- [hit_feedback_fix_proposal.json](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/examples/hit_feedback_fix_proposal.json) is the current bounded fix proposal example for the hit-feedback injected bug.
- when `repair_reported_bug` is waiting for a fix proposal, it now returns `model_fix_proposal_instruction` with the expected schema, candidate files, fix goals, acceptance checks, runtime evidence summary, and a compact replace-edit example
- [v2-model-fix-proposal-contract.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/v2-model-fix-proposal-contract.md) documents the fix proposal schema and examples for safe replace, candidate mismatch rejection, and broad edit rejection
- `repair_summary` includes bug source, repro status, failed check ids, runtime evidence ids, fix-plan facts, applied changes, rerun status, regression status, and artifact references
- `artifact_summary.by_stage` labels repro, proposal, application, rerun, and regression artifact paths
- `user_report` formats those summaries into structured sections and concise markdown for the user or AI tool
- real round `20260427-211825-006332` confirmed `user_report` appears in CLI output; repro, fix application, and bug-focused rerun passed, but final status was `regression_failed` due to fixed-regression `close_project` timeout after teardown was already verified
- top-level repair workflow support now lives in [bug_repair_workflow.py](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/mcp_core/bug_repair_workflow.py)
- real-bug rounds now persist under `pointer_gpf/tmp/bug_dev_rounds/<round_id>/`
- each round now records `baseline_manifest.json`, `bug_injection_plan.json`, `restore_plan.json`, and per-bug `bug_cases/<bug_id>.json`
- the current injected real bug kinds include:
  - `button_signal_or_callback_broken`
  - `scene_transition_not_triggered`
  - `button_node_renamed_in_scene`
  - `pointer_hud_not_spawned`
  - `hit_feedback_shader_not_updated`
- real round `20260427-185421-919628` injected `hit_feedback_shader_not_updated` into `res://scripts/enemies/test_enemy.gd`, reproduced the failure with `runtime_evidence_hit_feedback_flow.json` because `enemy_hit_count_after` stayed `0`, restored the recorded files, and verified the restored project with the same flow where `enemy_hit_count_after` became `1`.
- real round `20260427-191248-387259` injected `hit_feedback_shader_not_updated`, ran `repair_reported_bug` with the evidence plan and fix proposal examples, returned `status: fixed_and_verified`, wrote the repro/fix/application/verification/regression artifacts under `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame\pointer_gpf\tmp\`, restored `scenes/game_level.tscn` and `scripts/enemies/test_enemy.gd`, and verified the restored state.

Important current limitation:

- the repository now implements baseline recording, bug injection, bug-case files, and restore for the external test project
- the current mainline limitation is broader than one missing fix strategy: the model still does not reliably generate structured evidence plans from arbitrary bug reports without an external model step
- `apply_bug_fix` can now apply bounded model proposals, but the model still has to generate a valid proposal
- model evidence plans can now use `observe`, but the model still has to choose meaningful evidence targets from project facts
- the latest successful top-level behavior-bug repair used repo-stored example JSON files, so the next work should reduce the hand-written JSON requirement rather than add another fixed bug kind
- newer injected bug kinds can be used for controlled real-bug rounds, but those rounds should now be treated mainly as evaluation infrastructure for model-driven bug work
- GPF must not be planned as a game-specific or genre-specific operator. Codex, Cursor, or another AI coding tool should understand the target project and generate the evidence plan, operation sequence, and fix proposal. GPF should provide project facts, action contracts, evidence contracts, validation results, runtime artifacts, and result classifications for that model reasoning.
- Without a language model, GPF cannot realistically cover all game types, gameplay systems, and control schemes. Future work should improve context injection and model-facing contracts so the model can understand what to analyze for each project and generate the project-specific plan.
- future development must continue following [2026-04-21-gpf-bug-seeding-and-restoration-rules.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-21-gpf-bug-seeding-and-restoration-rules.md)
- the implementation order that led to the current round system is defined in [2026-04-22-gpf-real-bug-development-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-22-gpf-real-bug-development-plan.md)
- the mainline follow-up after that round system is defined in [2026-04-22-gpf-model-driven-bug-loop-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-22-gpf-model-driven-bug-loop-plan.md)
- the concrete user-facing target for that follow-up is defined in [2026-04-22-gpf-new-project-natural-language-bug-auto-fix-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-22-gpf-new-project-natural-language-bug-auto-fix-plan.md)
- the next runtime-side implementation plan for model-controlled evidence collection is defined in [2026-04-23-gpf-generic-runtime-evidence-primitives-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-23-gpf-generic-runtime-evidence-primitives-plan.md)
- the current three-step repair workflow execution plan and results are defined in [2026-04-23-gpf-model-controlled-repair-next-steps-detailed-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-23-gpf-model-controlled-repair-next-steps-detailed-plan.md)

python -m v2.mcp_core.server --tool run_basic_flow --project-root D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame
```

```powershell
python -m v2.mcp_core.server --tool run_basic_flow --project-root D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame --allow-stale-basicflow
```

```powershell
python -m v2.mcp_core.server --tool analyze_basic_flow_staleness --project-root D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame
```

Fixed regression expectation:

- if one flow is already running for `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`, the next flow returns `FLOW_ALREADY_RUNNING`
- if two Godot editors are open for `D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame`, `run_basic_flow` returns `MULTIPLE_EDITOR_PROCESSES_DETECTED`
- use `python D:\AI\pointer_gpf\scripts\verify-v2-runtime-guards.py --project-root D:\AI\pointer_gpf_testgame --check all` for a fixed runtime-guard regression without extra helper console windows

## Next Implementation Target

After the current repair-workflow implementation, the next target is no longer more planner or assertion refinement by default.

Preferred next target:

1. handle fixed-regression `close_project` timeout cases where `project_close.status` is already verified, so successful bug-focused repair is not reported as a generic regression failure without clearer classification
2. improve install and AI-tool entry docs after the repair report shape is stable
3. keep the real-bug round system stable as validation infrastructure

Latest implementation note:

- inference now looks for a startup button scene, a scene-transition target from the startup script, the target scene root node, and an optional runtime anchor scene such as a HUD
- if those signals are missing, generation still falls back to the old generic visible-click probe
- input isolation is now an explicit architecture requirement; see [v2-input-isolation-requirements.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/v2-input-isolation-requirements.md)
- the current implementation plan for that work is [2026-04-12-v2-input-isolation-plan.md](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/docs/2026-04-12-v2-input-isolation-plan.md)
- the first isolated-runtime slice is now implemented:
  - `run_basic_flow --execution-mode isolated_runtime` launches a Godot runtime onto a dedicated Windows desktop
  - `runtime_bridge.gd` writes `pointer_gpf/tmp/runtime_session.json`
  - `closeProject` quits the isolated runtime process directly instead of writing `auto_stop_play_mode.flag`
  - `project_close` is verified against the isolated runtime PID and stable stop window
  - result payloads now include `isolation.isolated`, `isolation.surface`, `isolation.status`, `host_desktop_name`, and `separate_desktop`
  - there is now a real host-desktop activity validation script that keeps moving the host cursor while isolated runtime flows run; the latest observed result still passed for both minimal and interactive flows
  - `runtime_bridge.gd` also adds automation-time input guards that reduce captured-mouse symptoms, but those guards should still be described as mitigation rather than as the full isolation proof
- the top-level user-request path is now split into `plan_user_request` and `handle_user_request`
  - `plan_user_request` resolves the supported high-level request into `tool + args + readiness`
  - `handle_user_request` currently auto-executes only safe next-step tools, not real runtime flow execution
- the server split is now materially implemented
  - `server.py` no longer owns the main request catalogs or runtime helper bodies
  - `tool_dispatch.py` now owns the main tool branch logic formerly in `main()`
  - `process_probe.py` and `teardown_verification.py` now hold the narrower runtime helper concerns that previously sat inside the orchestration path
  - current follow-up should prefer documentation and test hygiene over more structural splitting, unless a new high-level domain forces another boundary change
- `input isolation` remains important but is now considered later TODO work, not the immediate mainline
- `basicflow` remains important but is now considered "good enough for now" unless a bug-focused flow requirement exposes a real missing piece
- there is also a deferred regression-cleanup issue in shared `play_mode`
  - after the current module/CLI test collection plus `verify-v2-regression.py`, one Godot editor process for the active project can remain alive by design
  - this matches the current teardown contract, because `project_close.status: verified` only requires play mode to stop and the project editor-process count to be `<= 1`
  - users may see the leftover project editor window become `未响应` if they interact with it during or after teardown
  - future cleanup work should explicitly exit all remaining Godot processes for the current project after the regression bundle finishes
  - that cleanup must stay project-scoped: do not kill unrelated Godot editors or runtimes that belong to other projects open on the same machine

## Plugin Summary For Colleagues

The V2 Godot plugin source is stored under:

- [v2/godot_plugin/addons/pointer_gpf](/D:/AI/pointer_gpf/v2/godot_plugin/addons/pointer_gpf)

It is synced into a target project as:

- `目标工程/addons/pointer_gpf/...`

The runtime state used by V2 is stored inside the target project as:

- `目标工程/pointer_gpf/tmp/runtime_gate.json`
- `目标工程/pointer_gpf/tmp/command.json`
- `目标工程/pointer_gpf/tmp/response.json`
- `目标工程/pointer_gpf/tmp/runtime_diagnostics.json`

Responsibility split:

- `plugin.gd`
  - editor-side play-mode gate sync and auto enter/stop handling
- `runtime_bridge.gd`
  - runtime-side command polling and flow action execution
- `runtime_diagnostics_logger.gd`
  - captures Godot engine errors
- `runtime_diagnostics_writer.gd`
  - writes aggregated runtime diagnostics to disk

## What Not To Do

Do not re-expand V2 with:

- unbounded auto-fix that edits files without candidate-file and unique-match validation
- legacy repair orchestration that bypasses `repair_reported_bug`
- NL router
- Figma tools
- broad orchestration

Do not merge V2 back into the old huge `mcp/server.py` path.

## If V2 Appears Broken

Check in this order:

1. `project.godot`
   - V2 `[autoload]`
   - V2 `[editor_plugins]`
2. `pointer_gpf/tmp/runtime_gate.json`
3. `pointer_gpf/tmp/command.json`
4. `pointer_gpf/tmp/response.json`
5. `pointer_gpf/tmp/runtime_diagnostics.json`
6. external project resource UID consistency
